# Simple-CRUD-MySQLi
Simple CRUD program (HTML, Bootstrap 5, PHP, MYSQLi Connection)

Features :
- Create data
- Read data (ascending)
- Read data (descending)
- Update data
- Delete data
- Error Handling

Note :
-
In this case, I used id with auto-increment for the primary key. Therefore, the user doesn't need to fill in the primary key anymore.
To prevent the database from SQL Injection, only alphabets and numbers are allowed.
This is a simple CRUD program, so feel free to customize the program.
